Programming Project 

Instructions: Write a program in which the computer plays against a human opponent. 
Generate a random integer between 10 and 100 to denote the inital size of the pile.
Generate a random integer between 0 and 1 to decide whether the computer or the human takes the first turn
Generate a random integer between 0 and 1 to decide whether the computer plays "smart" or "stupid"
Stupid mode = computer takes random legal value (between 1 and n/2)
Smart mode = computer takes enough marbles so that the size of the pile is a power of 2, minus 1. 
Note: Computer cannot be beaten in smart mode when it has the first move (unless pile size = 15, 31, 63)
