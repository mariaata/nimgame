Explanation: Problem 1: Nim Game 
(5-12)First worked on the Game.java class; 
initialized instance variables and created a random number generator
(14-18)Created a constructor that randomly assigned the marbles between 10 and 100 
then initialized both human 
player and computer level of difficulty 
(20-end)Began the method to begin the game: my goal was to try to make simple instructions for the human player 
For each steps after the computer turn, I made sure to update the number of marbles left
However, I also had to make sure that the game.java and nim.java worked with the individualized files
- computer and human players
Added the array in computer.java and added a boolean 
-- made sure the marblesLeft did not meet/match any of the numbers in the array
I had to make sure that the computer would not take more marbles than that of the marbles left.
I also need to add this line, human player would not be able to choose a number of marbles than that of the marbles left. 
So, I added a line in the game.java class that had the same rules as the computer
-- tells the human to enter another number.
The code successfully ran and compiled!
